                    <p>This isn't Facebook Marketplace where randos can contact you about your vintage toaster. We're invite-only, which means:</p>
                    <ul>

                        <li>Only people we actually know and trust can see your stuff</li>
                        <li>No weird strangers asking if you'll take $5 for your $200 bicycle</li>
                        <li>Maximum awkwardness when Aunt Martha tries to lowball your couch</li>

                    <p><strong>Why we need it:</strong> So you can log in and so we can send you important stuff like "Hey, someone wants to buy your thing!"</p>
                    <p><strong>What we DON'T do:</strong> Sell it to spam companies or sign you up for weird newsletters about miracle weight loss supplements.</p>

                    <p><strong>Why we need it:</strong> Kind of hard to run a marketplace without knowing what you're selling.</p>
                    <p><strong>Fun fact:</strong> We promise not to judge your collection of ceramic frogs or that exercise bike you definitely used more than twice.</p>

                    <p><strong>What we store:</strong> Your name, profile picture (if you upload one), and any external login info (like Google or Facebook).</p>
                    <p><strong>Why:</strong> So people know who's selling what, and so we can show your beautiful face next to your listings (or your pet's face, we don't discriminate).</p>

                    <h5 class="mb-3 mt-4">üìã Your Activity</h5>
                    <p><strong>What we track:</strong> What you list, what you reserve, basic website usage stuff.</p>

                        <li><strong>Safety & Legal Compliance:</strong> If someone's doing something illegal or dangerous (like trying to sell stolen goods or that expired milk from 2019)</li>
                        <li><strong>Technical Services:</strong> Our hosting provider sees some technical data, but they're bound by strict agreements under UK data protection law and probably don't care about your ceramic frog collection anyway</li>
